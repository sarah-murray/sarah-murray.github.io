			<h3>Agent based model
			<img id="github" src="images/github_logo.png" alt="Link to GitHub repository"></h3>
		</a>
		<p>This is a simple model developed as part of my MSc GIS python programming module.</p>
		<p>The code models agents moving around and interacting with the environment and each other.</p>
		<p>In summary, the model:</p>
		
			<ul>
			<li>Reads in environmental data (DEM)</li>
			<li>Builds agents in space based on web data</li>
			<li>Randomises the movement of agents</li>
			<li>Gets agents to interact with the environment - "eat" data</li>
			<li>Gets agents to interact with each other - "share" data</li>
			<li>Animates the model</li>
			<li>Contains the model within a GUI</li>
			<li>Reads out environmental data</li>
			<li>Reads out .csv file with agent data storage</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>In this case, given that the environmental data consists of a DEM, a fun way to visualise the
		model is to imagine the agents as field geologists. The geologists wander around with their rock
		hammers, collecting	samples and taking holes out of the terrain. They meet up with each other and enthusiastically compare their
		samples before sharing them and	going their separate ways.</p>
